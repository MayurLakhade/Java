Difference between Statement and PreparedStatement:
1) Statement is parent interface
PreparedStatement extends Statement.

2) When using Statement the sql query is passed at the last moment when we call
   executeUpdate(sql) or executeQuery(sql).
   When using PreparedStatement the query is passed when we are creating the Prepared Atatement object.

3) Statement does not pre compile the sql query.
   PreparedStatement pre compiles the sql query.

4) Statement is used when the query is fixed and same query needs to be executed again and again without
   any changes.
    PreparedStatement is used when we want to change the values every time we want to execute it.

5) Statements commonly used for select type query.
   Insert, update, delete type queries are executed with the help of PreparedStatement.
