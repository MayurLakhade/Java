 Packages are used to group simillar classes, interfaces and enums together.

Uses of packages:-
1) naming convenience: we can make classes with same name in different packages.
 Hence we are able to use same name again and again.

2) Packages provide protection to the classes and interfaces because the access specifiers work on the 
  basis of packages.
  Example:- default methods or variables will not be visible from any class present outside the package.

3) Code reusability: if we want to use the code of class of some other package we have the option of importing that class in our program.

4) Easy to find classes and 

sub packages:- These are packages made inside another package.
