Difference between Abstract class and Interface:-

1) Abstract classes can have both abstract and concrete methods, Meaning abstract 
class gives partial abstraction.
Interfaces have by default all abstract methods, hence it gives full abstraction.

2) Abstract class can have constructors.
   Interfaces cannot have constructors.

3) Abstract class is extended by another classes using extends keyword.
   Interfaces are implemented by another class by implements keyword.

4) a class can extend only one abstract class.
   a class can implement many interfaces.

5) In an abstract class variables can be of any type.
   In an interface all variables are by default public, static and final

6) Interface and abstract class references can be made for upcasting.
